# Langchain-Project--
Langchain Project With LLAMA2 API

This project is a **LangChain-powered chatbot** built using **LLaMA2**, **Streamlit**, and **LangChain integrations**.  
It demonstrates how to create a conversational AI assistant that can answer user queries interactively through a simple web interface.

This project is a chatbot built using LangChain, LLaMA2, and Streamlit. The main goal of this project is to create a conversational assistant that can answer user queries in real time. By using LangChainâ€™s prompt templates and model chaining, the chatbot provides structured and meaningful responses to the user. The project also integrates LangChain Tracing v2 for monitoring and debugging purposes, which makes it easier to track performance and improve the model pipeline.

The chatbot interface is built with Streamlit, which provides a simple yet powerful way to create an interactive web app. Users can type in any question or topic, and the chatbot generates a response using the LLaMA2 model through the Ollama integration. This makes the project suitable for beginners who want to explore how to connect large language models with an easy-to-use frontend.

To manage sensitive information such as API keys, the project uses dotenv for environment variables. This ensures that the keys are not hardcoded into the codebase and can be securely loaded when needed. The .env file contains the LangChain API key and other project-level configurations like the project name. This setup not only improves security but also makes the project easily portable and scalable.

The project dependencies include popular Python libraries like langchain_core, langchain_community, langchain_openai, and streamlit. These libraries work together to handle prompt engineering, large language model connections, and the web interface. Additional libraries such as fastapi, uvicorn, and sse_starlette are included to support future API-based extensions of the chatbot.

Running the chatbot is simple: after installing dependencies, the user can start the app with streamlit run app.py. The chatbot then runs locally on http://localhost:8501, where users can interact with it. The design is modular, meaning that developers can easily extend it by adding new models, connecting databases, or deploying it on platforms like Render or Hugging Face Spaces.

Overall, this project demonstrates how to combine LangChain, LLMs (LLaMA2), and Streamlit to build an end-to-end chatbot system. It serves as both a learning resource and a strong base for developing more advanced AI assistants, such as chatbots connected with knowledge bases, document retrieval systems, or custom-trained models.
